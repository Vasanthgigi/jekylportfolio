Although there are a number of qualities that people feel that children should have, every person thinks that
some are more important than others. I am going to read you pairs of desirable qualities. Please tell me which
one you think is more important for a child to have.

1. independence versus respect for elders, 
2. obedience versus self-reliance, 
3. curiosity versus good manners
4. being considerate versus well behaved

This survey was found to be a [predictor for support of Trump here](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism). Interestingly it was [found to work very well for whites only](Perez-and-Hetherington.-Authoritarianism-in-Black-and-White6.pdf). It also reminded me of [Gary Svboda](http://adventusresearch.com/), a guy that helped me with my new businesss idea. I wrote [this survey](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/COMP-CO858/ExerbusSurvey%20-%20GS%20Comments%20-%20Feb%209%2011.docx) about my idea and Gary reviewed it.

In true Rich research fashion, I looked at Gary's work and found [this survey on customer satisfaction](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/COMP-CO858/satisfaction%20and%20mobile%20bahrtien.pdf
) with telecommunications.
