Until now I have tried to relate computer concepts to the fields of study represented in our class. Networking, the means by which computers, and us by extension, communicate is a concept that applies to any discipline. Furthermore, as soon as a computer is connected to a network it opens a powerful means of communication, but also a powerful tool for others to misuse. From [the pretest](tests/LANs.htm) you will see that my emphasis is on the basics of wired and wireless local area networks, but also on the steps that you can take to keep others from abusing the resources shared on a network.
