New Accessibility Technologies, Standards and Opportunities
=========

Accessibility requires huge rework on one of my customer's sites. Her attitude towards the work is that she will do it when she gets another sale. Could the rework be made more compelling to my customer if it was combined with something else. Perhaps not, because she is pretty fed up with her site and how old it looks, and has had terrible experiences trying to refresh the appearance of the site. We will [explore accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) and how it fits with the modern appearance of a site as well as search engine optimization.
