Systems Development: Emerging Technologies
===

> Most innovation is not due to the discovery of something new, but is instead the result of novel recombination of known concepts and materials. S.C. Gilfillan, 1935 et al.

With this course you will combine 10,000 hours of something that you already know, with some emerging technology to innovate in your new careers. We will survey some emerging technology with an emphasis, chosen by you, of human machine interface and privacy. There are 4 assignments, where you will have an opportunity to do something with emerging technology and your portfolio.

Assignments
---

Each assignment is 5% of your final mark, except for the UI assignment which is worth 25% of your final mark.

1. AODA compliant website, due June 2nd midnight
1. Semantic website, due June 16th midnight
1. UI Design mockup, due July 21st midnight
1. Evaluation of technology, due July 28

Midterm
---

The midterm will be July 7th. It will cover the material up to that date, currently Detailed outcome 1, 2  and 3 from the course outline. The midterm is worth 30% of your mark.

Final
----

The final will be on August 18th. It will cover the material from detailed outcome 4 - 9, and will *not* be cumulative. The final is worth 30% of your mark.

My plan is to spend a week on each detailed outcome, with the exception of UI. UI I would like to cover more thouroughly in 4 weeks with time to make a significant mockup. I would also like to spend 2 weeks on privacy, which I will build from the Intelligent Vehicles, Drones and Surreptitious Surveillance and Quantum Encryption detailed course outcomes.
