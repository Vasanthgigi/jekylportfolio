You all have great ideas, which you have fleshed out with a [paper prototype](http://www.paperprototyping.com/). For assignment 3, you will take a small part of your idea and make it more real and on the internet, where you can point to it in your portfolio. Over the next few weeks we will look at github, phonegap build and firebase as a way of creating a rapid prototype to try out part of your idea.

##Marking

21/25 of the total mark for getting something on your github page and on your phone.

###Extra Marks

These are my ideas for extra marks up to 25/25. You can also propose your own.

1. Animation - some sort of animation that fits with what you are trying to achieve. 
2. Back end - connect to data in a back end like firebase
3. Semantic Web - consume a service from the internet like google maps
4. actual user testing - show your app to a potential user and capture their reaction in a way that you can submit with your prototype for marking

##Submission

Submit your app, by putting a file on the course's dropbox (it could be a test report or some other artifact). The comments for your file should point me to a github repository.
