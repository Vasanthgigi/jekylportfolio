The objective of this course is to build a partially-working demo/prototype of an innovation.
We will look at techniques for innovation as well as some techniques for prototyping.

The deliverables for this course are:

deliverable|date|weighting

individual pitches|Monday September 21|10%
paper prototype|Monday October 19|20%
partially working demonstration assignment|Monday November 30|25%
team final presentation|December 7|
team final report|December 14|
technical content (from presentation and report)||25%
innovation content (from presentation and report)||20%
