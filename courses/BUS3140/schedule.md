IT Entrepreneurship
===================

*Entrepreneurship is the most fun that you can have with your clothes on - Alan Quarry*

New enterprises turn ideas into products, discover whether they solve problems that customers are willing to pay to have solved, and based on that discovery decide whether to pivot or perservere. In this course you will develop and present a business plan for turning ideas into products in a new commercial initiative.
