A database provides a tool to organize, use and understand potentially huge amounts of data. To learn database we will be using "Concepts of Database Management", by Pratt Adamski. I like this book, because, like the Heads First Web Design, it deals with the problem of starting from nothing and designing a database.

One of the first things that you will need for this course is a development environment. We will use [xammp from here.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.8.3/xampp-portable-win32-1.8.3-5-VC11.zip/download). You will need to unzip it on to your removable device. You can then start it with xampp control.
