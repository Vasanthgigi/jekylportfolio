The intention of this exam is to draw your attention to some examples that primarily tell the story of Angular.js and mobile development. There is [one example](https://github.com/rhildred/tellme) that is also intended to be an end to end app with shared state and push notifications of changes.

The test is based on these examples from github:

1. [https://github.com/rhildred/simpleangular](https://github.com/rhildred/simpleangular)

1. [https://github.com/rhildred/tellme](https://github.com/rhildred/tellme)

You will likely need to be able to run the examples to proceed. Please ask for help, if you can't run the examples. The [test is here.](tests/mobilefinal.htm)
