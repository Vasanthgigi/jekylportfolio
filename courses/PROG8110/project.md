#Individual Project

I am looking for you to get a small app of your choice on to your phone. In the past people have done quiz apps, magic 8 ball types of apps, simple games like [pong](https://github.com/rhildred/Pong) and non-working prototypes of larger apps, perhaps going on to build them later for the group project or as part of their capstone.

I would like to see a < 1 page proposal for what you are planning. We will agree on how your project will be marked from the proposal. The pattern will be:

85% for getting something that you can demo on your phone.

Up to 100% for achieving your whole vision of the small app.
