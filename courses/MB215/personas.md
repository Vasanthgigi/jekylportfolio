## Mapping requirements
### ... Rich's take

In class, I had intended to show Adzic's Agile Toronto Keynote talk on "Making Impacts not Software." Unfortunately, perhaps, I forgot that if you put [the presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/keynote-agile-toronto-2013) full screen, you can't see his slides, which he refers to a lot. I ended up giving Adzic's  presentation with my own twist on it. 

## Traceable Requirements

## Look a lot like traceable directions

What happens if I miss the left fork to keep on ON-11? I am driving and driving wondering if I have made a mistake. My wife asks me if I am sure about this, and when we finally agree that I am wrong, I have no idea how to fix my mistake, other than possibly getting turned around and going back to Barrie and trying again.

## Unless I have a GPS

## Or a map

If I have a map, I might even notice that a way to fix my mistake is to go through Bala, where there is this little ice cream store that I remember. Now I have an opportunity rather than a defect. Likewise a map of requirements gives an opportunity to recalculate our course when the situation changes, or we just make a mistake.

## The business model canvas

### ... is one such map

laying out the business goals, assumptions, and hypothesis. We spoke last week about deriving scope from goals. The business model canvas is a nice way to show the big picture goals and the linkages in between them. 

Let's say that the rules changed and that the 40 volunteer hours are no longer a requirement for high school graduation in Ontario. Does our business model canvas help find a new direction for our product. I suppose that it does, but there was no mention of the 40 hour requirement on the business model canvas at all. Perhaps we need a better, more detailed, map to recalculate our path to "providing opportunities for students."

## [Persona Empathy Map](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2014/05/persona-empathy-mapping)

A [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) is a character invented by the product team or stakeholders to put them in the shoes of or create empathy with the users of their product. For instance in class we invented a character we affectionately named "Last minute Joe." Joe has left the 40 volunteer hours to the very last minute. His guidance counsellor, Jill (also a persona), just wants to know if he has done his hours or not, without a long story from Joe. Joe and Jill help us plan for the impact of the 40 hours not being required any more. Joe goes away completely as a persona for this. Jill becomes more interested in some of the "softer" outcomes of volunteering during high school.

## Recalculate based on new opportunities

![personas](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZvqtqpLDL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "personas")![canvas](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9b/7b/03/9b7b03c4ab23652c1b26c2f02cb99183.jpg "canvas")

The idea of using persona empathy in design of products came from Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers and Changemakers and it's gotten more press lately due to Alex Osterwalder's book, Business Model Generation. Of course, that's where the business model canvas comes from as well. I think that both the business model canvas and personas add something to Adzic's idea of being able to recalculate our route based on new opportunities and challenges.
