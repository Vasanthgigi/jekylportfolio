#Software development is a cooperative game, like rock-climbing

This is a course in software methodologies. If you look at the course outline like a computer programmer you would say that these methods are well understood.

#A software developer would say software methods consist of:

* object oriented analysis and design, 
* software development life cycles, 
* models and methodologies, 
* quality assurance and improvement, 
* and the basics of tools used for application development

like an engineering discipline (and our course outline). Except people developing software together are more complicated than that.

#Communication
* People never communicate completely
* Gaps also in receiving
	* Experts jump larger gaps with their experience
	* Novice can't jump as big a gap because they have no patterns to base the current communication on.

In object oriented design we have design patterns that novices can look for to aid in this communication.

Is a "hero" of software methods. Cockburn was one of the signatories of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). I got the idea for software methods being a cooperative game like rock climbing from [this presentation](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Alistair's+scum+talk). To me this presentation has stood the test of time and kind of stands on it's own.
