#Project 1 - Java Game

![Android game example](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB215/DFSnake.png "Android game example")

The objective of this project is for you to experience getting an Android game onto a device as a team. Each team will make an Android Application Package (apk) and install it on at least 1 team member's phone. The actual game will be first created on a laptop using [Greenfoot](https://greenfoot.org). A mark of up to 85% will be awarded for just [modifying an existing game](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB215/Greenfoot-5thingsAboutObjects-gh-pages.gfar) in greenfoot, and getting it to a state where you can demo it and the changes that you made to the class. Additional marks up to 100% are available for getting the game on Android. 

Like the course, this project is not so much about you becoming a software developer. It is more about you becoming aware of the challenges that teams developing software face, and how those challenges are managed. If you achieve a score above 85% on this project, you will also gain an understanding of the challenges that software app developers face in targeting mobile devices. For more instructions on how to go about getting your game on Greenfoot please refer to [this previous article](https://rich-hildred.rhcloud.com/MdToHtml/Greenfoot-5thingsAboutObjects/README). For more instructions on how to get your app on Android please refer to this article. Have fun!
