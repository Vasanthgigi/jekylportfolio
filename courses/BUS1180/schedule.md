Customer Service
================

We have already seen Shep Hyken's story about the taxi. In reading the book, I think that he misses an important point. I am spending the rest of the week adding that important point on to Hyken's work. Because there was so much interest in pricing during the photoshop demos I have decided to use value based pricing as a way to create pull for the rest of the material.
