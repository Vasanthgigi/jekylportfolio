Programming: Web Design and Development
=======================================

A number of CAD teams implemented their CAPSTONE projects in phonegap with a php/mysql backend. This is an attractive platform, because php and mysql are readily available on the internet for free. When the teams chose this technology combination they were able to get something that they could show to their customers very quickly. If you embrace the material in this course, you will have everything that you need to be a full stack web developer.

Previously in this course, I spent way too long on environment. This time I am going to start with a simpler environment and build up to puting it live on the internet. We have 16 weeks together by my calculation, loosely broken down as follows:
