The final project will be to add crud functionality using the techniques from class to update the products table from the first project. The [project start](https://github.com/rhildred/PROG8020ProjectStart) has been updated with a template.

The changed files in the projectStart are:
1. www/index.php
2. views/crud.phtml
3. creds/google.json
4. composer.json

You will need to make parallel changes to your own project so that you can edit your products.
