![plan-B pets](https://rhildred.github.io/PROG8020ProjectStart/www/images/planbHallelujah.png "planb-b pets")

##Goals

Customize the code at [https://github.com/rhildred/PROG8020ProjectStart](https://github.com/rhildred/PROG8020ProjectStart) to make it be about something product oriented but not about pet services. You will also need to set up your own mailer service url for the contact page by logging in with a google id at  [https://rich-hildred.rhcoud.com/login](https://rich-hildred.rhcoud.com/login)

##Marking

Up to 85% will be awarded for making the site about something other than pet services and getting it live on Openshift.

###Extra Marks

Up to 100% will be awarded for doing enhancements to the code. Possibilities for enhancements include:

1. adding multiple images per product and showing them in a carousel like [the boat project](http://apps.syndicateme.net/BoatProject).
2. making the carousel underneath the featured product not contain the featured product.
3. making the carousel underneath the featured product show the products in a different order or a subset of the products based on the chosen featured product.
4. add a way for people to leave reviews or comment on the featured product (you might try [disqus](https://disqus.com/))
5. do your own blogger integration
6. instead of using the mailer service at [https://rich-hildred.rhcoud.com/login](https://rich-hildred.rhcoud.com/login) use the composer package `rhildred/mailer` or your own mail solution for the contact form.
