It is, in my opinion inappropriate to do a big design up front for agile software development. There is [university level research](http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/1/papers/1786/download) that indicates the same thing. Agile software, using the scrum technique has the following deliverables for which the scrum master is responsible.

###Sprint 0 - (Inception 20%) Due Jan 29

1. Some sort of project inception document, that could look a lot like the [phase-gate project charter](http://www2a.cdc.gov/cdcup/library/templates/CDC_UP_Project_Charter_Template_LITE.doc). Looking like the phase-gate project charter is no accident as project owners and major stakeholders will need something to sign off on before funding development.
2. A backlog of user stories to get the project started. The backlog can be managed in a [system like greenhopper](https://get.atlassian.com/jira-software/?_mid=c1b6c317cf18640e51972c41490e3395&gclid=Cj0KEQiA0Na1BRDlkqOcyczng5cBEiQAnEDa2AgE47ZiIj_y0E3EjZqnDTkSyalTvL4WTHO7Oo10CIEaAso58P8HAQ), which is based on a defect tracking tool Jira that is often used in industry. Or the backlog can be managed in a [trello board](https://trello.com/), which would be my preference as it is free. You can use a chrome extension like [fireshot](http://getfireshot.com/) to capture the backlog to a pdf that can be uploaded to the dropbox for that iteration.

### Sprint n - (Construction n 20% x 3) Due February 26th, March 18, April 8

1. The stories planned for that iteration captured at the start of the sprint. The capture should also show the backlog. You can use a chrome extension like [fireshot](http://getfireshot.com/) to capture the backlog, stories for that iteration and stories completed in previous iterations to a pdf that can be uploaded to the dropbox for that iteration.
2. A demo of the working software that you did for that sprint.
3. A 1-1.5 page retrospective saying what worked well, and what didn't work so well in the previous sprint.

1. Working software and source code on bitbucket or github.
