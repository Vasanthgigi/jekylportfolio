CP104 BR Programming Challenge
============================

One aspect of this course that is mentioned in the syllabus is that 

> This course may be "challenged for credit".

A number of you have come to me, asking the form that this would take. This is my proposal.

You will make a python chatbot for a messaging platform. There is a [recent example here.](https://medium.com/ddouble/how-i-came-to-love-an-annoying-millennial-bots-are-people-too-3d25fc2a14d8#.wn9rlqd76)

Should you choose to accept this challenge you will make a Kik or other messaging chatbot in python and publish it on a free heroku account. You will publish to heroku via github, and I will require links to both your github and the identity of your bot on heroku to give you a mark for the course.

The asignment is in lieu of all other evaluation for this course.

You will need to create a project charter for your chatbot. The project charter will be worth up to 20%. There is a [template here](https://www2a.cdc.gov/cdcup/library/templates/CDC_UP_Project_Charter_Template_LITE.doc)..

In this template you will need to list 6 minimum success criteria for your project. If you implement all 6 and get the project up on github and heroku you have made an "A" effort.

You will also need to list as many more extra criteria as you can think of. If you can get 2 more of these extra success criteria you will have done an A+ effort. 3 or more and full marks will be given.

If you complete the project charter but not the rest of the project, I will give you credit for the first assignment. The project charter and the first assignment are both due on January 27th. The completed challenge is due the last day of classes Apr. 3.

This is what is called a portfolio challenge. It needs to be on subject matter and written in such a way that it would improve your chances of employment were you to show it to an average employer in a field that you are interested in. 

It is anticipated that you are writing this because you are already proficient with the material that is covered by the other assignments, midterm and final. I will endeavour to help you with this during lab time, but I do need to help those that are still working on the basic course outcomes with the highest priority.
