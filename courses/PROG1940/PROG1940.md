Creating E-Commerce Web Sites with PHP and MySQL
================================================

PHP is an incredibly useful server side programming language that is almost as ubiquitous as JavaScript on the client side. PHP is also used for popular content management systems like Wordpress and Drupal, so even if you don't program, you can still end up using php. In this course, I would like to look at some things like Drupal and Wordpress plugins as well as go through building some e-commerce directly in PHP.

The project will be of your choosing, and can be done on wordpress or in php alone. You will need to pick something in which e-commerce is applicable, be it accepting donations or payments for products.
