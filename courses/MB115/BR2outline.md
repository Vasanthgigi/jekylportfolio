##Services for Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities or special needs are advised to contact Laurier's Special Needs Office for information regarding its services and resources. Students are encouraged to review the Calendar for information regarding all services available on campus.

##Required Text

**Using Information Technology: A Practical Introduction to Computers and Communication, 11th Edition Complete**, Brian K. Williams and Stacey C. Sawyer, 2015 McGraw-Hill .

##Course Overview

This course provides a conceptual survey of general systems theory followed by a conceptual and technological survey of the structure of distributed information systems architectures, operating systems, network operating systems, peripheral technology and user interfaces.

This course is intended to give all Business Technology Management students a high degree of comfort and familiarity with information technology, which students will take forward into their future courses and into the workplace. Topics covered include the internet, application and
system software, hardware, storage, communication, networking, security, privacy, data management, system design and analysis, and future technologies. Basic HTML5 scripting will also be covered. Coverage of each topic will be at an introductory level, with the starting assumption that students have no existing knowledge in that area. This course will give students the confidence to discuss IT intelligently with others, to solve basic IT problems, and to use basic IT solutions.

##Class Format

The course is combination of lecture and lab time. Lectures will be held on Wednesdays and Fridays in Brantford Odeon OD200. Labs will be held on Wednesdays in SCJB23 starting on Wednesday January 13.

##Attendance Expectations

My expectation is that you will attend every class, both lecture and lab-based. The lectures and the labs will sometimes be based on the textbook, but not always. The lab exercises will often be based in content delivered during the preceding lecture(s). If you miss a lecture you may be unable to complete the associated lab exercises. Test questions will be based on lectures and lab exercises.

Information will often be given in class about upcoming classes, test information, and project information. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find a fellow student who is willing to update you on what content was covered and information provided. I do not provide lecture notes, summaries, or updates to students who have missed classes.

You are expected to be in class, but I understand that situations, such as illness or a death in the family, do arise. If you are going to miss class, please email me or tell me in advance.

##Evaluation
The grades outlined below are the only grades available for this course. There will not be any extra credit opportunities for low or missed grades. As university students, it is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the course material and are able to demonstrate your understanding through the course expectations and requirements.

|Item|Percentage|Date|
|---|---|---|
|Lab Exercises|20%|
|Mid-term Examination|20%|**Wednesday, February 10th**|
|Project|25%||
|Final Examination (comprehensive)|35%|

##Lab Exercises
A series of exercises will be provided to students at the beginning of class, and you will be assigned marks for the completion of these exercises. The format of the exercises will vary depending on the topic being covered. Sometimes marks will be assigned for attempting an exercise, sometimes finishing the exercise will be required, and sometimes a certain result will be expected. You are welcome to work with fellow students on your lab exercises.

The 20% of the course grade assigned to lab exercises will be spread out over the semester. Some labs may be worth more marks, others less, but on average each lab will be worth 2% of your final grade. If you miss ONE lab class over the course of the semester it will not affect your lab exercise grade. Any lab classes missed beyond the first one will be assigned a mark of 0. You cannot make up lab classes outside of our regularly scheduled class time.

##Mid-term Examination
The mid-term examination will be held on Wednesday, February 10th during class time. It will cover chapters 1 through 5 and 7 of the textbook, and all lecture and lab material up to, and including, Friday, February, 5th.

The mid-term examination will not be offered at any other time. If you miss the mid-term for health or bereavement reasons you must provide appropriate documentation as per the academic calendar. If appropriate documentation is provided, the weighting of the final examination will be increased to 55% in consideration of the missed mid-term. If the mid-term is missed for any other reason, a mark of 0 will be given.

##Final Examination
The final exam will cover all of the material in the course. The final exam will be held during the final exam period, Apr 7 - Apr 23, 2016, and will be scheduled by the Registrarâ€™s Office. You are expected to be available during the entire exam period. If you have more than one exam scheduled for the same time, or if you have three or more exams scheduled to start and end within a 24-hour period, the university will defer one of your exams to Slip Day. The university chooses which exam will be deferred. No other alternate arrangements will be made for exams. If you miss an exam for any reason, including weather, health issues, or a death in the family, you will be required to submit a petition to the Brantford Faculty Petitions Committee in order to write the exam at a later date. If your petition is successful, the exam will be written at some point during the two following semesters.

For complete university policy and procedure information regarding final examinations please see the Undergraduate Academic Calendar.

##MyLearningSpace
The course has a MyLearningSpace area. It will be used for posting the course outline, assignments, groups, etc, as well as any announcements such as new or revised readings or class cancellations. Written assignments will be submitted through MyLearningSpace, and grades will be posted there as well.

**Do not email me through MyLearningSpace.** Emails sent through MyLearningSpace do not go to the recipient's Laurier email account, and I cannot guarantee that I will check MyLearningSpace regularly.

##Contacting the Instructor
The best option for contacting me is to drop by my office or to set up an appointment, between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm Wednesdays and Fridays. I am always happy to meet with you if you have questions or concerns.

Do not expect responses to email on the weekends or after 5:00 pm during the week. If you have questions about assignments or the exam, you need to be organized enough that you can ask them during regular business hours.

##Electronic Hardware Policy

All cell phones, smartphones (Blackberries/iPhones/Android) etc. must be turned off during class. Please ensure that your devices are off and not on vibrate or ring to avoid distracting other members of the class. Also be aware that some of these devices cause static in some of the campus lecture hall speaker systems so it is important to ensure that they are off and not just on stand-by. This policy has also been set due to the distracting nature of texting during class.

Students who cannot adhere to this policy will be asked to leave the classroom.

Laptops/netbooks/tablets may be used in lecture for word processing purposes ONLY (i.e. no web browsing, social networking, games etc.). Please ensure that any other software is turned off (not minimized) during class. Using any other software is prohibited since research (and past experience) has shown it to be distracting to those students seated in front, beside and behind you. Also remember that prior to class, during breaks etc., other students can view your screen so you should take caution in using other software at these times. Students who cannot adhere to this policy will be asked to leave the class and/or may lose marks at the discretion of the instructor.

Audio recording of lectures is permitted for the purposes of personal studying only. Rebroadcast or distribution in person or via the internet of an audio recording from one of my lectures is only permitted with my written consent. Video recording (and still pictures) of lectures (or lecture material) in whole or in part is not permitted.

If I see a cell phone, laptop, iPad, mp3 player, or any other similar device in your hand or near you during a test or an examination, you will automatically receive a 0.

##Academic Integrity
Please note that students involved in academic dishonesty may receive a zero grade on the course and even notation of academic dishonesty on their transcripts. In this course, academic dishonesty includes copying or use of unauthorized aids in all written work; plagiarism; submission of work generated for another course without prior clearance by the instructor of this course or aiding and abetting another student's dishonesty. Wilfrid Laurier uses software that can check for plagiarism. You will be required to submit your work in electronic form and have it checked for plagiarism
