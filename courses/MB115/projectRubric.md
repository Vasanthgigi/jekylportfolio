There are a few presentations in the course content that I did as lecture extras, about related topics that I found interesting. Thankfully there were a few that you seemed to find interesting too:

1. The [Work/Life Balance](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/lecture2.html) ... particularly the part on the rise and fall of Blackberry.
2. [(Cloud) Application Software](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/lecture4.html) ... You could show some cloud apps that you like to use.
3. [Hardware - Input/Output](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/lecture7.html) ... I looked at watches and strain gauges as would be used in a bicycle crank. In class today, I added material on watches and took out the crank piece.
4. [Denial of Service Attacks](https://mylearningspace.wlu.ca/d2l/le/content/168239/viewContent/919272/View) ... This is a powerpoint presentation. Part of your job would be to convert it into impress.js.
5. [Marketing to a segment of 1](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/lecture9.html)
5. [The Turing Test](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/lecture10.html) ... This was a single slide with a video. There are a lot of places that it could be taken and remain "PG." Big Blue, the chess playing computer comes to mind.

##Project
I would like you to take over one of these presentations and make it yours. You could take it in a new direction, add more material or re-structure what is there to be clearer to you. This project is out of 25.
