In lab 8 we tried to edit the html in an impress.js presentation. In discussion with the class, we decided that it was a big step to learn html and impress at the same time. This lab focuses on html only. You will use the instructions from lab 8 to create a new gh-pages project on github. Then you will create an html page from scratch on a topic of your choice. You will need to use all of the elements from the article that I did on html.
