Imagine that there is no hot drink machine in the BTM lounge. This may be easy if there actually isn't one. Form groups of 3-4 and write a business case to put one in. The business case should include a technology choice, along with purchase information. You may want to use the [business case template from CDC unified process](http://www2.cdc.gov/cdcup/library/templates/CDC_UP_Business_Case_LITE_Template.doc "business case template from CDC unified process").

The steps that you may want to go through are:

1. As a team, make up a starting word template for you to put your work into
1. Assign sections, except for the executive summary, to the different team members
1. Create a dropbox account if one of your members doesn't already have one
1. Turn on `track changes` and upload the template to dropbox and share with the other members on the team
1. Work independently on assigned sections for approximately half of the time remaining in the lab
1. Reconvene as a team, and write the executive summary
1. Merge everyone's contributions in to a final document
1. Save as a .pdf and upload to the dropbox
1. Put the team members names in the description portion of the dropbox

This lab is worth 3% of your final mark:

1. up to 1% for consistent formatting
1. up to 1% for references (Note* the CDC template doesn't use footnotes or endnotes, but rather a different section for references) You can choose to use endnotes, footnotes or to follow the template.
1. up to 1% for good goals and success criteria for the project
