Welcome to Javascript! The great thing about it is that javascript is ubiquitous. The other great thing about it is JavaScript wars between google and mozilla. Because it is everywhere and people are working on it, Javascript is a very useful programming language. Purists would say that it isn't a very good first programming language, but it [has good parts](http://javascript.crockford.com/) and lots and lots of examples. In addition to the examples and the excellent Javascript and jQuery missing manual text I will be covering a javascript loader written, like jQuery, by John Resig. [John Resig](http://ejohn.org) and Crockford are the personas of the language and an interesting read themselves.

December 12|Project Demo

The project is to be of your choosing. I am interested in doing a javascript shopping cart that works with Express Checkout. There is an opportunity to write some serious games for a learning disability, and we have 2 people coming to pitch to us. I also looked at this neat sliding div thing with Jon that would be fun to build a project around.
