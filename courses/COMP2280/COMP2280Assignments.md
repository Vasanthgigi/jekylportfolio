Comp 2280 IT Support Project Assignments
===================================

**Assignment 1** will be a student lead class. Possible dates and topics are listed above.

IT support projects are being undertaken by teams. These teams will meet for one hour once a week between now and the final date of August 21st to facilitate the project.

The total project will form 60% of the final mark, divided into the remaining 4 assignments.

The 60% is composed of:

**Assignment 2** - Project Charter – total 15 marks

Please use the project [charter template provided](courses/COMP2280/ProjectCharter.doc). A preliminary project charter is due *Friday the 10th of July at midnight*. A revised project charter is due with the rest of the project deliverables. The customers will sign off on the initial project charter and the revised project charter. 

**Assignment 3** - Versioned Cloud Deployment - total 15 marks

The site will be deployed using git on Openshift. Sites will be made active by *Friday July 17th* so that each team can show the progress that they are making directly to the end customer. When finished the deployed sites will be compared to existing sites in a similar category to give specific feedback.

**Assignment 4** - Customer Training – total 15 marks

Customers have chosen Wordpress for the ability to maintain the site going forwards. They will need training and support to make this a reality and to keep it a reality as they get new staff. *August 14th*

**Assignment 5** - Presentation – total 15 marks

The presentation is not so much a walkthrough of your site itself. It is a ~20 minute description of how you solved the customer’s problem, and reached his goals. It is primarily from a business perspective, but also should include technical problems, if any, faced and overcome. *Aug. 21*

The ease with which real companies have engaged with your work, says something about the demand for this activity. The customers all have a story that they really want to tell. They will be delighted with having a content management system to get their story out, and you will have a project on the internet that you can point to during an interview.
