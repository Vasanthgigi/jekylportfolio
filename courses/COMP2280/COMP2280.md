IT Support Project
==================

This course is intended as a series of case studies to support a successful software project.

The project itself will be a competition in teams to train a customer to support their own website. The projects will be implemented in Wordpress, using techniques defined in INFO2120. The first portion of the course, up to the final, will consist of the non-Wordpress aspects of producing a system for a customer. The remaining portion will be dedicated to hour long team meetings with facilitator.
