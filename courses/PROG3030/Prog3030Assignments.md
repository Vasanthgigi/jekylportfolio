The idea of the Assignment is for the presenters to teach the class something about the technology or process. Because we are all programmers here, the way that I have thought about the project is as an extended use case. Cockburn is quoted in Wikipedia, (and I have annotated) as saying that a use case consists of:

>    Title: "an active-verb goal phrase that names the goal of the primary actor"

>    Primary Actor - who would this technology/process be useful to?

>    Goal in Context - what would be a likely goal for the actor using this technology/process?

>    Scope - what aspects of this technology/process make it a better choice for some things than others?

>    Level - what level of skill is required to use this technology/process, or what level of abstraction is assumed by the technology/process?

>    Stakeholders and Interests - who would the actor be trying to serve with this technology/process, and what are the interests that this technology/process would help the actor meet?

>    Precondition - what would already have to be in place for this technology/process to be useful?

>    Minimal Guarantees - what is a minimal result that an actor could expect from this?

>    Success Guarantees - what might be the actor's criteria for success in using this technology/process?

>    Trigger - what needs trigger the use of this technology/process?

>    Main Success Scenario - step by step breakdown of using technology/process or a demo?

>    Extensions - "a condition that results in different interactions from .. the main success scenario"

>    Technology & Data Variations List - similar products, high level comparisons ....

>    Related Information.

For instance if I were doing Future IT Trends from the B group of assignments, I might pick a systems architect as my actor. The actor s goal might be to select technologies that will continue to be supported in the future. The scope of the trends might be to inform choices among technologies, but not to aid in detailed design with a particular technology. ... For the main success scenario, I might enumerate some trends, but more importantly I would sell how I discovered the trend, and why I thought it was important. I might also stress the technology & data variations in the context of similar technologies in the past.
