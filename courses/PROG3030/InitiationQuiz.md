This test is intended to draw your attention to the main ideas of project initiation. An example of these ideas is question 7 and 8, the difference between project plan and charter. The test is open everything (except collaboration). You will have time in class, but also feel free to do it now. The [quiz is here.](tests/projectiniriationquiz.htm). Good Luck!
