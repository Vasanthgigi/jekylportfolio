Advanced Programming w Visual Studio C#.NET
===========================================

Like Descartes and Desire 2 Learn, we will start web programming, with C# .net. The pattern that we will be using is Model View Controller (MVC).

![Model View Controller](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg "Model View Controller")

Model view controller is a design pattern for structuring larger applications in a way that teams can work on them in layers. You can read more about the [theory behind MVC here](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html). 

We will split the class into 2 equal sections again. The first part will be for working through the exercises in the book, plus a couple of applications that I have found to be useful in this environment. I have 4 of these topics to cover, in the context of where related ideas appear in the book.
