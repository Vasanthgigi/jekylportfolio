Resizing an Image In a Web Page
===============================

There will be lots of time for this when we do web design, but it is so easy I thought I would include it now:

	<!Doctype html>
	<html>
	<body>
	<img src="BensDogsAndCats.svg" style="width:100%" />
	</body>
	
	</html>
	
The active ingredient is the `style="width:100%"` attribute of the img tag.
Basically the code just includes the image in a web page and uses a CSS 3 style to
make it always be the full size of the screen.
