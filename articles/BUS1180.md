We will be covering customer service using this book by Shep Hyken. In the book, Mr. Hyken says that to align customer experience and employee experience, a mantra is required. This week on Thursday we will get to spend some time with our serious game end customer and the consultant who is bringing us together. I would like to consider our mantra for experience with this customer to, "engage students and the local software industry in a sharing of learning, innovation and livelihood." More about this, when you have had a chance to read the book.

* Note: We will do part 5 of the book together so you "only" need to read to pg 205
