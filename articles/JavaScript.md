I love JavaScript!!!!!!!! It is a dream come true for me to be able to write server and browser code in the same language, using the same libraries and the same constructs. The easy integration of native code, both in phonegap  and in the node.js package manager is also really exciting to me. I have used the node package manager (npm) to write an object module [js-toolbox](https://npmjs.org/package/js-toolbox) and also a [test runner](https://npmjs.org/package/assert-runner) that we will use in class.

For the course we will use the book "JavaScript & jQuery ... the missing manual" by David Sawyer McFarland, and [ecopy of which is here.](http://it-ebooks.info/book/363/) I picked this book, because it broached the idea of a first progamming language very well. I also was inspired by the part on regular expression, which I have never seen handled so well. The chapters we will be covering are:

|Day| Topic | Chapters | Example|
|--|--|--|--|
|1, 2 |Javascript Basics| McFarland Chapter 1,2,3 | test driven development using my npm package assert-runner|
|3| Event driven programming and introducing jQuery | McFarland Chapter 4,5 | Validation on form submit|
|4, 5| Ajax |  McFarland Chapter 11, 12 | Server Side proxying to get around same origin policy|

_Note:_ This is an updated schedule from the start of the week. I have a solid amount of material that I want to cover with you on server side proxying, chapters 11 and 12 and need more time. My thinking is that we will forgoe backbone and the advanced topics in favor of spending more time on Ajax.  


There is a lot of material here, and a lot more in the book than I have chosen to cover. Both the pocket guide and the missing manual are intended also as books for your career rather than just books for this class. I will also use JavaScript and the mysql2 npm module when it comes time to do database, so that we will have another chance to do JavaScript more justice.
