Photoshop Project
=================

On Friday I would like you to pitch a new website to the class and I. I would like the pitch to be backed by a .psd demo and a proposal letter. The demo needs to include screens for at least 320x480 and a desktop experience. I put a couple of sample letters on the desire to learn page.  

One approach that you might take is a responsive redesign of a website such as http://fox.com like [the demo I showed in class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRwFo4L2CLo). In the demo he uses an OSX program called paparazzi. There is a better addon for firefox called Screen Grab. If you use it with the web developer tools, you can grab screens at various resolutions as well as an entire screen as a png. Following is a screenshot of my firefox showing the 2 plugins:

You can add new addons to firefox by clicking on the `Firefox` orange button in the top left corner of the screen. Select `Add-ons` and type the name of the addon you are searching for in the search bar.
The http://fox.com also included some mobile widgets. You can get widgets from a psd file at [this page](http://www.bentdesignstudio.com/v2/2012/03/twitter-bootstrap-2-photoshop-template-psd/), but you could also use [jquery mobile widgets](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/). There is also a [bootstrap demo site here](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/getting-started.html#examples). _Hint:_ Show the bootstrap or jquery mobile examples in the resize web developer tool to get the look for a mobile device. 

I posted some actual letters on the desire to learn page, but here is a sample more generic letter that you might use:

>	August 23, 2013
>
>
>	`name of offerer`
>
>	`email of offerer`
