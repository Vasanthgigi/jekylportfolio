FireWorks Project
===============

For a FireWorks project, I would like you to consider a different website than
you did for your photoshop project. I would like a:
 
1. "high fidelity" prototype at
2. 320x480 and 
3. 1024x768 (desktop or landscape tablet) including a 
4. master layout an index or home page and 
5. 2 other pages at a minimum. I would also like this site to have a 
6. vector logo. Please make a 
7. letter of offer as well.

There is a [reference that I found helpful for Logo development here.](http://www.powerlogos.com). An example from a logo developed according to the principles espoused is:

[![earthkeeper logo](http://www.powerlogos.com/logos/logo-earthkeeper.png "earthkeeper logo")](http://www.powerlogos.com/portfolio-earthkeeper.htm).

There will be a chance for you to pitch your design to the class on Friday. I
would like the 2 (340x480 and 1024x768) fw.png files as well as the offer letter
.doc (or .pdf) and the logo in a .svg file submitted to the d2l dropbox by Friday at
midnight.
