Web Design Project
==================

Hopefully all of you have had the experience of someone, when they discover that you are studying web design, telling you about the web design that they would like created. This is your chance to delight them!

Probably the most difficult part of product development is starting with an idea and a whole bunch of 0xfff and making a useful product out of it. The Head First Web Design book gives some good pointers, but it also gives some cautionary tales of people doing a really good job of building the "wrong thing." Eric Ries in his book "The Lean Startup" talks of some more.

I would like you to sit down with a customer/cousin/friend and go through the process outlined in the book, adapting it to your situation as needed to build the right thing for them. The deliverables I would like are an offer letter, some sort of prototype, be it on paper, fireworks or photoshop and a finished web site on OpenShift, that you can demonstrate in class on the 22nd.

The project materials are due in D2L DropBox November 22nd at midnight, but I have found that when you need people to prepare things like photos or copy it can take a long time, so am giving you lots of advance notice.
