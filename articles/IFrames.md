IFrames
-------

IFrames are those things that look tacked on to a web site that have, probably deservedly, gotten a bit of a bad name for themselves. Basically an iframe lets one present a page inside of another. Above, we have a video of Chris Monteith from Monitech in an IFRAME. More on that later. The code for this video is below:

`<iframe frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZgxAPRNABPM?feature=player_detailpage"></iframe>`

A student in one of my previous classes did a web site for a cottage rental. This was a case for embedding a google calendar in the website to show the availability of the website. By creating a new public calendar and going to it's settings, the following IFrame code is provided for copy and paste:

	<iframe
	src="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?title=Rich's%20Classes&amp;showTitle=0&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=eid9s8n13n1jlm4qigk4f3eqi8%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%232952A3&amp;src=en.canadian%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%23691426&amp;ctz=America%2FToronto"
	style="border-width: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"
	scrolling="no"></iframe>
	
Finally, a number of students have put twitter feeds in their web pages using this technique.
