Vectors
=======

In class there was a discussion about people ordering signs and other large
print media and suggesting that "Just use the logo from our Website" is a way to
get a logo. Many website graphics are raster or bitmap graphics. Bitmap graphics
when enlarged on a sign or even in PowerPoint can look terrible! Paradoxically
bitmap graphics can also look "jaggy" when they are shrunk in size. The vector
image format that can be displayed natively on IE9 and other browsers on the web
is a scalable vector graphic (svg). Let me share a "User Story" on SVG.

I love WebRTC and think that it is the future of non in-person communications.
When I was looking to do some PowerPoint on the topic I came across the first
logo below. Unfortunately it looked terrible on my PowerPoint. SVG to the rescue!

!["New with SVG"](images/webrtc-long.svg "New with SVG")

The good news is that the graphic looks much sharper as a .svg. The bad news
was that for it to render correctly in Chrome and Firefox I had to use a "web
safe" font (Comic Sans MS). There is a list of 
[web safe fonts here.](http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html)

To convert a graphic from a bitmap to a vector in Adobe Fireworks.

1. Click on a uniformly colored area with the eyedropper tool to pick up the color for the fill.
2. Click on the same area with the magic wand.
3. Right Mouse over the selected area (your cursor will change)
4. Select `Modify Marquee` and `Convert To Path`
5. Repeat until all of the paths are displayed in layers above the bitmap.

Note: you can turn off displaying the bitmap behind to see as your work progresses.

Vector graphics that can be displayed natively on the web are in the .svg
format. You can possibly get a nice svg by navigating to the `Commands` menu,
selecting `Export` and the `Export SVG` . For a complex path this had
disappointing results. Instead I ended up saving the image in .ai (adobe
illustrator) format. In adobe illustrator I could save the image as an svg.

This is a more complex path that my wife commissioned my son to do so that on her cards she could have pets peeking out of the letters in her name.

The original, as scanned on a multi-purpose printer looked like this:
