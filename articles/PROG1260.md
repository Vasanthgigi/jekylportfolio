PROG 1260 - Introduction to Programming with Visual Studio C#.NET
=================================================================

.NET is used by at least 2 of the bigger software companies in town, Desire 2 Learn and Descartes. Both companies use .NET to run a federated network to provide service to their customers.

This course, using [Robert Miles' C# Yellow book](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/) is a gentle introduction to the C# language as well as some object programming concepts. Since we started test driven development in JavaScript, I will also do an advanced topic on tdd. You have 2 weeks to work through the Rob Miles book, as well as get an at home development environment going using [the microsoft Dreamspark resource](https://www3.conestogac.on.ca/msdnaa/login.jsp?FromDepartment=conestoga_engit). To run a development environment on a MAC you will need some sort of virtualization software. I use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). At the end of the 2 weeks will be a midterm.

The last 2 weeks will be a project. Since this will be a thick client app there will be no need to integrate it with the cloud. In the past, I have done simulations with an introductory C# class (birds on a wire is my favorite). Unless some better idea surfaces during the first 2 weeks, I will program a simulation, and work with the class to make new simulations based on mine.
