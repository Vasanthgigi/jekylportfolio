Mobile First - My Vision of Web Development
===========================================

If you are just starting to do software development now, mobile is your big
opportunity! When my dad started developing software in the early 1970s cash
registers were being networked with the mainframe computers of the time to
revolutionize big retailers with new information. People like my dad were
required to help make that happen. When I started developing software in the
early 90s ubiquitous microcomputers, legacy mainframes and everything in between
were being networked together to share information on the internet that would
change the world.

Now, another 20 years later people are networked on their
couch, in their car, even in the bathroom thanks to mobile. In the same way that
my dad and I were needed to make the networked information of our times
available, today's software developers are required to build out the mobile trend. I
hope that developing the software that people will use in the next 20 years will
be as much fun for you as it has been for my dad and I.
