Why use a CMS
=============

Possibly in a moment of frustration, a person new to Drupal said, "Why do we use a CMS again?"

Drupal does an imperfect job of this in that some structural things like page templates and stylesheets are in code, while other structural items like menus, blocks and views are stored in the database.
