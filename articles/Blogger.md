Blogger Integration
===================

People use a website to communicate with their audience. Blogger is one way that communication can be two way. An organic food store, for instance, can have a blog of recipes that can be made with the food. Then someone searching for a recipe for Kale, might discover where said Kale could be purchased, fresh and ready.

Another great thing about blogger is that posts made on blogger that have your menu in the template can be used by, not only for people that are interested in how your blog articles relate to the rest of your site but to the Google crawler.
