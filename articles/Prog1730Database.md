A database provides a tool to organize, use and understand potentially huge amounts of data. To learn database we will be using "Concepts of Database Management", by Pratt Adamski. I like this book, because, like the Heads First Web Design, it deals with the problem of starting from nothing and designing a database.

After the break we will do a project, from a starting point that I will provide. The first week back will be to understand the starting point and the remainder of the time will be for you to make the project your own, and get it going on Openshift.
