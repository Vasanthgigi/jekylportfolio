Web Real Time Communications
============================

Is your team more distracted together than working together? Web Real Time
Communications (WebRTC) will turn group distraction ware into team learning
ware. WebRTC, a technology for voice video and data communications in a browser
and some recent studies on team learning and flow have the potential to send
groupware products like Outlook and Notes the way of the rotary dial phone and
the cubby-hole. 

In 1990 I wrote an email client/MUA that was part of a groupware
product that ran on Novell Netware. It was a character based interface, but had
the metaphor of cubby-holes;

to show whether a logged in user had mail, and to show if other users were out
of the office. You don't hear much about cubby-holes anymore, but the basic
premise of the most used groupware products, Outlook and Notes hasn't really
changed since computers became standard on everyone's desk and pc based
communications products took over from the previous generation of terminal based
products. Other office tools like phones and conference bridges, while possibly
having screen sharing haven't changed all that much in quite a while either.

The recent release of Web Real Time communications in the chrome and firefox
browsers and a beef that I have about current offerings like Outlook, Notes and
the Hub being too distracting from real life has drawn me to a new vision for
teamware. To inform my vision with the most recent research about teamwork, team
learning and the opposite of distraction, team flow I did a final MBA
independent study project on the subject. I have learned some things writing
that paper that will bring me closer to my dream of inventing something that
will make our real lives as engaging as a video game.

Web real time communications is the enabling technology that can make a
teamware that couldn't have existed until now and will make our online life an
extension rather than a distraction from our real lives.
