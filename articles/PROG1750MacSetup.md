ActionScript FDT Mac Setup
==========================

We will be writing both our back end data source and front end data consumers in the Eclipse IDE. To add ActionScript to the Eclipse IDE is basically a 2 step process.

1. Get and use the apache [flex sdk installer](http://flex.apache.org/installer.html)
1. Add the fdt plugin to your eclipse by going to `Help/Install New Software`, clicking `add` and putting  `fdt`  and `http://fdt.powerflasher.com/update/fdt5/` in the resulting dialog:

![fdt update site](images/PROG1750FDTUpdateRepository.png "fdt update site")

You should be able to click through the prompts to install fdt.
