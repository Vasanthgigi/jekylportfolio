Fireworks is Optimized for Web Design!
======================================

Lee and I were talking in class, and he asked me about the differences between Photoshop and Fireworks. I didn't give him the best of answers. This is what I would have said, had I thought about it a little more:

Fireworks provides scaled down from Photoshop photo-editing features. In addition it provides:

1. Support for multiple pages that all share common elements.
2. Vector support that includes reading and writing to .svg (with supplied plugin) and strokes and fills.
3. Sprite sheet support for animation
4. Javascript behaviors like mouse-over
5. PDF wireframes
6. Export to css and images
7. Editing of jQuery mobile themes.

During the next 2 weeks, you will have a chance to spend some time with
fireworks, in class and for the project.

As a group we will focus on the pages, vector and export as css plus images.
For the project the focus is on producing a main and subpage with shared
elements. The pages will need to be in 2 sizes 320x480 and 1024x768 (landscape tablet or desktop) at a minimum.
We will also produce, in class and for the project, designs that work with Twitter
Bootstrap.

With respect to Twitter Bootstrap, the .psd that we used with Photoshop for
simulating a UI began it's life as a Fireworks Resource. Please find [the resource here]

Please note that the fireworks one is towards the bottom of the page.
