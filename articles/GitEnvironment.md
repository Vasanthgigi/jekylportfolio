Live on the Internet!
=====================

A major focus of this program is the development of a portfolio that you can show to prospective employers on the Internet. We will be using freemium (free to start) cloud services for this. [AppHarbor.com](https://appharbor.com/) for C# and [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) for all of the other environments that we will work with. Both of these services provide you with a virtual private server (VPS) on the internet that hosts your application. A VPS is a dangerous thing because as soon as it is created unscrupulous operators are trying to hack into it and take it over for a bot. To make sure that the server stays private to you all traffic between your working environment and production must be encrypted.

Lets take a look at this working and production setup:
