Students working in teams of 2 came up with their own idea for the site. This was assignment 5. Assignments 1-4 related to the user requirements and experience that they were trying to fulfill. Students were encouraged to find a small target user segment. Northern Threads "want to target Canadian individuals who have an established presence on the business or entrepreneurial scene, as well as anyone who is trying to join this group for the first time. More specifically, we intend to target those pursuing the fast paced business world in the Greater Toronto Area. We will be targeting men and women between the ages of 21-45 who are in a middle-upper class or higher salary bracket, are in a hurry (time is money!) and always on-the-go, and also require business formal attire in the workplace." (Assignment 2)
