A student got speaking with their hairdresser. The hairdresser had been promoting the business on Face Book. The student convinced the hairdresser to get a website so that customers could book appointments without calling in and interrupting someone else's appointment. Customers can book via facebook messenger or with the wordpress site the students created.
