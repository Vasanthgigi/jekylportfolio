This was the first assignment for a software methods class. I was able to get a student (from this group) to actually say, "How do we work together on this?" I used that as a hook for git and the second project which was to get another java web tech project using the Spark framework up on Openshift 2. As well as configuration management with git, we did collaborative requirements gathering using Gojko Adzic's Specification by example book. We also did testing using Cem Kaner's Bug Advocacy. This group did 2 games with an interface to switch between them. The other one was called "stump the Trump."
