Students have completed a portfolio as a 1 session introduction to cloud computing, as part of their job search course and as part of a user experience course. This is one of the better examples done near the end of a second career program job search course. This particular student had studied to be an electrical engineer and worked at Blackberry. The student that did this site also led a Saturday morning html class put on by Laurier business students.
